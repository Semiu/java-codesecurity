## Exploring Machine Learning Models and Techniques for Java's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

This repository contains different research projects on Java CVEs.

### 1. Text and Static Analysis of Java's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures in GitHub's Projects.

The details of this project can be found in the `java-cve-analysis` folder. This is a completed part of the research project.

The `javavultextdata` contains different data on Java CVE descriptions. The most important is the `mitrejavacve.csv` which is the Java CVEs scraped from the MITRE website.

This can be updated by running the `java-cve-analysis/1-data-scraping-curating/javacvedatascraper.py` script.

### 2. Classification of MITRE's Java's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Descriptions

The details of this project can be found in the `java-cve-text-classification` folder.

### 3. Automated Detection of Software Vulnerabilites in Java Program Source Code.
The details of this project can be found in the `java-cve-detection` folder. This is an ongoing part of the research project.
