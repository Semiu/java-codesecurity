### Analysis of Java's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures in GitHub's Projects

This ongoing project is in partial fulfilment of the degree of Master of Science, Software Engineering.

The central question aimed to be answered by this study is: How secured are the codes written in the top 100 GitHub's Java projects (measured by their stars)?

In answering this central question, the following are the objectives of the study:
* Identification of Java's CVE entities through text analysis of MITRE's vulnerability descriptions.
- This aims to identify the dominant Java CVEs by identifying the CVE name entities through the text analysis of the 

* Identification of security-related themes in the projects' commits through text analysis of the commit messages.
* 
* Identification of vulnerabilities in the GitHub's Java projects using Variant Analysis with CodeQL.
