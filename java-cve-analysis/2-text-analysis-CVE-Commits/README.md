2. Text analysis (in `2-text-classification-CVE-Commits` folder)
* In `1a`: Text pre-processing to extract vulnerability phrases from the Java's vulnerability descriptions extracted from [MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/).
* In `1b`: Analysis of the extracted vulnerability phrases with `NLTK` and `Wordnet Lemmatizer` to actualize vulnerability-representative tokens. These are visualized to identify the prominent Java vulnerability tokens from the MITRE.
* In `2`: Tokenization of the projects' git commit messages and identification of mutual tokens with the MITRE's Java vulnerabilities tokens.
* In `3`: N-gram (two and three) analysis of the MITRE's Java vulnerabilities descriptions.
