5,CVE-2021-21610,"Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not implement any restrictions for the URL rendering a formatted preview of markup passed as a query parameter, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability if the configured markup formatter does not prohibit unsafe elements (JavaScript) in markup."
6,CVE-2021-21447,"SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence platform, versions 410, 420, allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious JavaScript payload into the custom value input field of an Input Control, which can be executed by User who views the relevant application content, which leads to Stored Cross-Site Scripting."
7,CVE-2021-21283,"Flarum is an open source discussion platform for websites. The ""Flarum Sticky"" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn't store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension. Forum administrators can disable the Sticky extension until they are able to apply the update. The vulnerability cannot be exploited while the extension is disabled."

374,CVE-2020-11069,"In TYPO3 CMS 9.0.0 through 9.5.16 and 10.0.0 through 10.4.1, it has been discovered that the backend user interface and install tool are vulnerable to a same-site request forgery. A backend user can be tricked into interacting with a malicious resource an attacker previously managed to upload to the web server. Scripts are then executed with the privileges of the victims' user session. In a worst-case scenario, new admin users can be created which can directly be used by an attacker. The vulnerability is basically a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) triggered by a cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) - but happens on the same target host - thus, it's actually a same-site request forgery. Malicious payload such as HTML containing JavaScript might be provided by either an authenticated backend user or by a non-authenticated user using a third party extension, e.g. file upload in a contact form with knowing the target location. To be successful, the attacked victim requires an active and valid backend or install tool user session at the time of the attack. This has been fixed in 9.5.17 and 10.4.2. The deployment of additional mitigation techniques is suggested as described below. - Sudo Mode Extension This TYPO3 extension intercepts modifications to security relevant database tables, e.g. those storing user accounts or storages of the file abstraction layer. Modifications need to confirmed again by the acting user providing their password again. This technique is known as sudo mode. This way, unintended actions happening in the background can be mitigated. - https://github.com/FriendsOfTYPO3/sudo-mode - https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sudo_mode - Content Security Policy Content Security Policies tell (modern) browsers how resources served a particular site are handled. It is also possible to disallow script executions for specific locations. In a TYPO3 context, it is suggested to disallow direct script execution at least for locations /fileadmin/ and /uploads/."

1285,CVE-2018-11101,"Open Whisper Signal (aka Signal-Desktop) through 1.10.1 allows XSS via a resource location specified in an attribute of a SCRIPT, IFRAME, or IMG element, leading to JavaScript execution after a reply, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-10994. The attacker needs to send HTML code directly as a message, and then reply to that message to trigger this vulnerability. The Signal-Desktop software fails to sanitize specific HTML elements that can be used to inject HTML code into remote chat windows when replying to an HTML message. Specifically the IMG and IFRAME elements can be used to include remote or local resources. For example, the use of an IFRAME element enables full code execution, allowing an attacker to download/upload files, information, etc. The SCRIPT element was also found to be injectable. On the Windows operating system, the CSP fails to prevent remote inclusion of resources via the SMB protocol. In this case, remote execution of JavaScript can be achieved by referencing the script on an SMB share within an IFRAME element, for example: <IFRAME src=\\DESKTOP-XXXXX\Temp\test.html> and then replying to it. The included JavaScript code is then executed automatically, without any interaction needed from the user.
