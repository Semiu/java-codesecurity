### Analysis of Java's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures in GitHub's Projects

This project is in partial fulfilment of a degree of Master of Science, Software Engineering, NDSU.

The central question answered by this study is: How secured are the codes written in the top 100 GitHub's Java projects?

In answering this central question, the following are the objectives of the study:
* Identification of Java's CVE entities through text analysis of MITRE's vulnerability descriptions.
* Identification of security-related themes in the projects' commits through text analysis of the commit messages.
* Identification of vulnerabilities in the GitHub's Java projects using Variant Analysis with CodeQL.


#### Research Process
1. Data curation (in `1-data-scraping-curating` folder)
* Java vulnerability descriptions are extracted from [MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/) and [IBM X-Force](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/) websites. These are saved both as comma-seperated values (CSV) files and in a MySQL database.
* The list of top 100 Java project names is extracted.
* Each of the top 100 Java projects are cloned.
* Commit log for each of the top 100 Java projects are generated.
* The commit logs are parsed and saved as a CSV file. Specifically, the commit message and sha as identifier are extracted seperately and saved in another CSV file.

2. Text analysis (in `2-text-analysis-CVE-Commits` folder)
* Text pre-processing to extract vulnerability phrases from the Java's vulnerability descriptions extracted from [MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/).
* Analysis of the extracted vulnerability phrases with `NLTK` and `Wordnet Lemmatizer` to actualize vulnerability-representative tokens. These are visualized to identify the prominent Java vulnerability tokens from the MITRE.
* Tokenization of the projects' git commit messages and identification of mutual tokens with the MITRE's Java vulnerabilities tokens.

3. Variant analysis using CodeQL
* Conversion of the codebase to database for CodeQL functionality using this command from the home directory. 

 *codeql database create database --language=language-identifier*
 
  Example: codeql database create C:\Users\Semiu\JavaCodeQLDb\zxing_zxing --language=java
 
  The detailed process of creating CodeQL databases can be found [here](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/creating-codeql-databases/).
